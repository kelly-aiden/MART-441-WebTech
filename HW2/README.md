This was my first time really coding with html and CSS since fall of 2023 when I took Web Design as a CS major. Man was I rusty. I had to relearn a lot and reverse engineer some of my old codes (relearning rem and vh units and padding and allignment and all that). It still isn't fully functional the way I want, for some reason my info containers refuse to be centered unless it's in a narrrow window. Unfortunatley I also had a crazy busy week so I din't take the time to really learn a lot of these concepts as much as I should have, instead just reusing code from my old assignments without 100% grasping how it worked. I hope to spend much more time this week to knocking off the html and css rust.
