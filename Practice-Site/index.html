    <p>
        I do not miss doing this (coding) but it is like riding a bike (I started college as a CS major actually)

    <h3>
        Reasons I don't like coding
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It's incredibly tedious</li>
        <li>It takes forever</li>
        <li>There is such a disconnect between what I want to do and what syntax will allow me to do, it feels stiffling</li>
    </ul>
