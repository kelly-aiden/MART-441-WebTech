        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>I was born in raised in Helena, Montana, but Missoula has become my home. I spent many years as the math and science kid, raised in a town that did not respect the arts culturally. As a result I simply wasn't exposed to much art, and when I was, I felt ostracized. So I came to UM originally as a CS major funny enough, and after a year and a half of that I switched to Astronomy which I enjoyed far more. But during those first few years here I was acting on the side and was in a number of shows here at the university. Through that I was exposed to such a wonderful community and world of the arts that I had never felt before, and it sparked me. So last year I made the switch to find my artistic passions. I suspected that would lie in Media Arts, hence the Media Arts major, but little did I know painting and dance would steal my heart much more. Now I spend most of my time either dancing, painting, or acting, but I still have a soft spot for technology and what it can offer, even if it may not be what I will most likely focus on outside of school.</p>

          <h2>A little Something Extra</h2>
          <p>I had one passion long before math, technology, painting, or acting: Taekwondo. I had pretty severe sensory issues as a child and was pretty bad at handling my emotions, so my dad put me in Taekwondo. And for 7 years, it was my everything. I got to be a 2nd degree Black belt and competed in countless tournaments. I eventually fell out of love with it but I know for a fact that my discipline and drive would not be half of what it is without my time in Taekwondo.</p>
          <p>Most of my gaming when I was younger was single player games, but not all of it. My favorite memory from gaming comes from Minecraft. My friends convinced me (a sprinter) to do summer cross country practice since they were all long distance runners. We would all go on runs at 7 in the morning, but afterwards we would all go home and play Minecraft for hours. It's incredible what 5-12 teenage boys can create when they all put their minds to it. I still go back to that world to see everything we built and to reminisce over that summer.</p>
