- Once again with the AI generated product, the functionality is great, it does everything it needs to do, but it lacks human pizaz and creativity. The layout was fine but plain, same goes for the images chosen, the story beats feel random and directionless. As well the javascript seems a little busy. One of the things I like about human code is tha we have additional goals that the AI doesn't really have. We want our code to be organized well for our preference so we can easily navigate it. I try to make concie solutions when I can to reduce clutter in my code, for ease of use and also just less typing. AI doesn't have those desires so its code feels a little bloated. It was well designed from an ease of use though, it is quite good at handling the more technical aspects of the project.
